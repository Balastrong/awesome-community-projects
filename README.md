### [World_words_app](https://github.com/federicorex/World_words_app.git) by @[federicorex](https://github.com/federicorex)

This is a very basic language learning app focused, at the moment, on English and German, intended for personal use to learn and track vocabulary progress. There is no front-end side and it has minimal back-end functionality. It would be great to integrate it with the community, expand language options, and seeks feedback on its potential for future development. Thanks.

Stack: JS (back-end)
